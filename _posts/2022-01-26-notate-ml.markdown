[Notate ML](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notate-ml/id1605408700) is an iOS app that helps you create object detection datasets from the comfort of your phone.

- Create a dataset and type, scan, or speak your labels into it
- Snap new pictures, or import old ones from your photo library
- Crop images, draw bounding boxes, tag and label objects of interest
- Export images and annotations for training with YOLO, Apple Create ML, or Google Auto ML
